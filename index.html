            <h3>Clinical Note Utility</h3>


            <h4>Productivity Application | ABELSoft Inc.</h4>
            <!-- Project Details -->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    Developed a standalone utility in C# to automate compiling and
                    resolution of conflicted doctor’s notes upon customer onboarding by
                    using Diff algorithm, saving significant time and human resources.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> C#, WinForm, OfficeXML, DiffPlex, MSSQL</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Challenges & Achievements:</strong> Initially faced architectural challenges in 2020.
                    However, in 2023, with improved architectural understanding, I re-architected the solution, leading
                    to reusable code and enhanced maintainability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The utility revolutionized the clinical note resolution process, saving
                    significant time and resources. Post improvements in 2023, the diff algorithm enhanced readability,
                    aiding stakeholders in decision-making regarding note restoration. It positively impacted the entire
                    Development department.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contribution:</strong> I led the project. While another developer, Sean, initially
                    contributed an algorithm, my enhanced version replaced it. The new algorithm utilized C# for data
                    cleaning and classifying insert, update, and delete statements, over the original T-SQL based
                    approach.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Feedback:</strong> The project received accolades from the CTO, development manager, and
                    team lead. A manager's commendation highlighted the project's impact, my technical prowess, and
                    problem-solving skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Duration:</strong> Initially developed in a week. However, significant improvements were
                    made over 2-3 weeks, enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Learnings:</strong> Emphasized the importance of creativity in repetitive tasks and the
                    value of discussing opportunities with peers for enhanced ideation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Future Scope:</strong> Explored the integration of ChatGPT for note restoration
                    decision-making, but it was abandoned due to data privacy concerns.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    Developed a Python tool to crawl all word entries from renowned English dictionaries, namely
                    Cambridge, Oxford, and Longman. This tool was primarily built to accumulate a comprehensive dataset
                    for subsequent Natural Language Processing (NLP) endeavors.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To gather a rich dataset from reputable dictionaries for advanced
                    linguistic research and NLP projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Beautiful Soup, Requests, MongoDB.</li>
                <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Used web scraping techniques to target specific elements of the
                    dictionaries' web pages and store the retrieved information in a structured format.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Faced issues with dynamic content loading on some pages and implemented
                    workarounds using asynchronous requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Results:</strong> Successfully crawled over 100,000 word entries with pronunciation, word
                    usage examples, and synonyms/antonyms, providing a robust dataset for NLP tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications and Future Enhancements:</strong> This dataset can be used for linguistic
                    research, building language models, or even creating a new dictionary application.</li>
